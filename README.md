## :whale2: Introduction

**Orca** is a **free-to-use** Roblox script hub designed to make your experience **easy** and **satisfying**.

Use many different **action cards** on the [**Home**](https://github.com/richie0866/orca#house-home) and [**Apps**](https://github.com/richie0866/orca#iphone-apps) page, or check out what we have featured on the [**Scripts**](https://github.com/richie0866/orca#newspaper-scripts) page.

Press `K` to open or close Orca. For the best experience, HD resolution is recommended!

## :rocket: Quick start

You can run the latest version of Orca with:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync("https://github.com/richie0866/Orca/releases/latest/download/Orca.lua"))()

Do note that when used with auto-execution, Orca will start minimized by default!
